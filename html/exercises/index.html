     <p>I want to make a website that tracks migraines. The website will allow users to track both migraine symptoms, medicine and care, and daily events that may impact migraine. It will allow users to store common triggers for easy input. It will allow for tracking of sleep, food and water, alcohol and drugs, exercise, stress, hormones, and other things! My superpowers are still growing.</p>
